# Introduction:
This is a small piece of software that generates random equipment that you can use in game to keep it fresh, or challenging, or anything you want.\
I personally have had a lot of fun with this so far.

# Usage
Launch the executable after installing it into a folder/with the installer.\
Then select your settings and press generate!\
*do note how it will only generate 'No Overclock' with default settings, as it defaults to using your selected Overclocks only.*

# Finally
I hope you enjoy this thing. It was fun to make.\
If you want to give me any tips / information about bugfixes/crashes let me know. There are some things I do still want to add to this, but they will come over time.\
Rock and Stone!

# More information I guess
If this program does ANYTHING shady let me know asap. It shouldn't.. but then yet again I did use a compiler and setup-creator from the internet that I don't know the source code off.\
I used pyinstaller for the .exe (which is probably reliable as it's installed through pip) and nsis for the installer-exe
